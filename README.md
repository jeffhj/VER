# VERüó£Ô∏è

The official repo for "[VER: Learning Natural Language Representations for Verbalizing Entities and Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11093)".


## Introduction

We pretrain VERüó£Ô∏è: A Unified Model for **V**erbalizing **E**ntities and **R**elations. The model takes any entity or entity set as input and generates a sentence to represent the entities and relations, i.e., "**natural language representation**".

## Trained Model

We release the VER-base model on [this repo](https://osf.io/7csnf/?view_only=91ec67e05bd44f998d71e63d9cdd25a4). VER-large and the pre-training data will be released later. If you want them earlier, feel free to send me a request.
